NCBI provides SRA data in the cloud to support large scale hyper parallel data analyses. Starting with version 1.6.0 Magic-BLAST downloads SRA data from the cloud providers rather than NCBI servers. Benefits include uninterrupted downloads, faster download speeds, and huge bandwidth for parallel downloads to multiple ruining processes or cloud instances. For more information see [SRA in the Cloud](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sra-cloud).

To take advantage of the increased download bandwidth when running Magic-BLAST in the cloud, please configure SRA downloads, using ```vdb-config -i``` program from [SRA Toolkit](https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools).

Here are webinars prepared by NCBI SRA group for how to set up a cloud instance and configure SRA downloads:
